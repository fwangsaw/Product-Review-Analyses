       "  'body': 'I’ve been a long-time fan of Crocs, but these yellow ones have truly won me over for both their comfort and style. I’ve worn them on multiple occasions, from casual outings to quick trips around the house, and they’ve held up beautifully while keeping my feet happy the whole time.\\n\\nThe comfort is unbeatable. The Croslite foam construction offers soft cushioning with every step, making these perfect for extended wear. Whether I’m running errands or standing for long periods, my feet never feel fatigued. The adjustable strap in the back allows for a custom fit, keeping them securely on my feet without feeling too tight. The arch support is surprisingly good for a casual shoe, which is a huge plus.\\n\\nDespite being made of lightweight material, these Crocs are incredibly durable. I’ve worn them in various environments—wet and dry—and they still look brand new. They’re easy to clean (a quick rinse with water and they’re good to go), and the soles offer excellent traction, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. They’ve handled everything from beach trips to quick walks without showing any signs of wear.\\n\\nThe bright yellow color is a fun, bold choice. While Crocs are known for their quirky style, I find the yellow to be surprisingly versatile. It’s a cheerful pop of color that can complement a casual summer outfit, or just add a bit of flair to a laid-back day around the house. They’re perfect for anyone who wants to stand out with something more playful and vibrant.\\n\\nThese yellow Crocs are more than just a fashion statement; they combine comfort, durability, and style in one easy-to-wear shoe. Whether you’re lounging at home, heading to the beach, or running errands, they’re the perfect footwear for effortless, all-day comfort. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone who values comfort and a bit of fun in their footwear!',\n",

I gave up my last pair several years ago due to fair wear of the crocs.  i wore them everywhere, indoors and outdoors.  Comfortable and can wear with or without light socks.  I prefer without socks!\\nI realized this past month that I really missed having Crocs to wear around the house instead of slippers.  Crocs last a lot longer than slippers!  They may not be as cozy as slippers but wearing them with socks for warmth in the Winter is totally acceptable.  Thank you Amazon for selling this great product in my favorite color of PURPLE, they arrived today and I love them. They are great year round and last a lot longer than slippers even outside!!!',\n",

       "  'body': \"SIZING + FIT: 1) I wear an exact women’s size 8.5. Sometimes size 9 so I can add a Dr Scholl arch insole.  I ordered these Crocs in two different sizes so I could try them and return the size that didn’t work. The size women’s 9 was too large/loose. The size women’s 8 fit me best, but not perfect.  2) The right shoe is somewhat larger & looser than the left, and the heel strap is longer.  3) I tried inserting a Dr Scholl insole in these Crocs. It did make the shoes more snug on my feet, and added arch support.  The insoles stayed in place.  But, it just felt wrong to put an insole in a Croc shoe since I bought these for orthopedic comfort & support, so I removed them.  4) My husband also just ordered these exact Crocs from Amazon in size Men's 11.  He normally wears a size 10.5 or 11 shoe. They fit him okay, but they are somewhat loose on his narrow feet and he ends up walking duck-footed, with his toes pointed outward, to keep them from slipping.\\n\\nCOMFORT: 1) After reading A LOT of reviews, I concluded that the comfort of Crocs are unique to each person. People with wider feet seem to really love them. People with foot or back problems love them. People with narrower feet aren’t usually impressed by them.  2) I sit & stand at my desk all day and these shoes are more comfortable than flip flops, but not as comfortable as high quality sneakers.  3) I have high arches and these shoes are tolerable, but don’t really offer much arch support.  Perhaps my feet will eventually mold to the rubber – time will tell.  4) These Crocs have a slight cushioned insole. They are not hard plastic, and the insole has a little bit of cushy give when I take a step.  5) When wearing these shoes for extended periods, I notice pain in the ball of my feet - metatarsals.  6) The little nubs inside these shoes are soft enough that they don’t bother me or hurt my feet. That says a lot because I have very sensitive feet!  7) I find these shoes to be more comfortable and slip less when I wear them with socks.  8) I have a knock-off brand of Crocs with removeable orthopedic insoles. Those were initially comfortable on my feet, but the longer I wore them the more my feet hurt. The knock-off brand cost MORE than these Crocs ($33 vs $26).\\n\\nLOOKS + COLOR: 1) Well, what can I really say here except I really didn’t buy these for looks. They look like wide orthopedic shoes.  Oh yeah, that’s because they are!  Comfort overruled style in my case.  2) I bought some cute white flower charms on Amazon and that made my Crocs look more feminine and added a little something that was needed.  3) I ordered these in the color CHOCOLATE because I wanted a neutral color that didn’t draw attention to my huge orthopedic shoes. In the listing photo they look kind of sparkly, but they aren’t. They are a light, soft brown, almost a taupe color.  Later, IF this shoe style grows on me (remember, I’m a newbie Crock wearer) I may try some other fun colors like pink or red.\\n\\nOTHER + GOOD TO KNOW + TIPS:  1) As other reviewers mention, these shoes squeak as you walk. Each step is “squeak, squeak, squeak…”.  2) In my opinion, Crocs are not ideal for narrow feet like mine. The shoes feel loose and I had them slip off while walking, which could be hazardous. I would not walk in these shoes for long distances or on uneven ground or on steps.  3) I heard that Crocs can be loosened or tightened using a blow dryer or in a clothes dryer.  I tried to tighten mine using a blow dryer on high heat, held 6 inches away, then let cool.  I was hoping the material would slightly shrink, especially the heel strap which is too loose.  Unfortunately, this heat method did not work for me. *If you try this, USE CAUTION so you don't ruin your shoes!  4) I read many reviews where people said their Crocs shrunk or warped when left out in the sun or in a hot vehicle , so keep that in mind.  5) The holes in the plastic help ventilate enough that my feet don’t get super hot. Yes, my feet sweat a little in these shoes. There is a slight foot odor when wearing without socks. That is to be expected with rubber shoes.  6) I prefer to wear these shoes with socks because it helps with sweating and my feet don’t slip as much.  7) The tag on these shoes says Made in China. The bottom of the shoe is imprinted with Made in China. They have a tag that warns about riding on escalators and holding children’s hands at all times. I would never wear these on an escalator, but there must be some reason they include this tag – probably because of known issues of the rubber soles getting stuck on escalators.  8) I have no idea if these are “authentic” Crocs because this is my first pair and I have nothing to compare to.  I checked the official Crocs’ website and the shoes I received from Amazon look exactly like those on Crocs’ website.  9) At the time of this review, I paid $26 for these Crocs on Amazon.  This same style on the official Crocs’ website is priced much higher at $49. Amazon offers a lot more color options than Crocs’ website.  10) I found where Amazon sells a slightly different style of Croc brand shoes that I might try “Crocs Unisex-Adult All Terrain Clogs with Adjustable Heel Strap”.  The adjustable heel strap may help in keeping my feet from sliding around. That style is a lot pricier at $41.\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION: As a newbie Croc wearer, I am not totally convinced these shoes live up to all the hype and amazing reviews I read.  Like I said, I don’t think these are ideal for my narrow feet. I don’t feel safe wearing these outside my house because my feet slip in them so much.  I will most likely wear these inside my house, inside my RV or around the campsite.  PS- I am really disappointed that these didn’t meet all my expectations, and I am envious of all the people who rave about these shoes.\\n\\nI paid full price for these Crocs and was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope you found it helpful.\",\n",

I wear them to do chores inside the house since we have hardwood floors and my feet hurt if I'm barefoot. I went back and forth on the color but ended up choosing Quartz - which is a pretty pale pink. I like this color because it is understated and perfect for summer. I usually wear size 10.5 narrow - and purchased the size 10 Women's. The shoe length is good - but the shoe is a bit wide for my foot. But, I still walk in them just fine. I just got home from walking the dog in my new Crocs and was happy that the shoes are waterproof. I think they'll be perfect for the beach this summer!\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Pretty much the only shoes that my son wears anymore I just buy them two or three new pairs of these every year and he's happy he doesn't want anything else he doesn't want tennis shoes he wants Crocs. They're comfortable for him he loves them they last pretty good and he's really hard on his shoes they're not very expensive and he absolutely loves him. Personally I don't like them that much I don't like the texture that's on the bottom of your foot it feels funky to me so I won't wear them but my son really loves them and my daughter she enjoys them too I don't know how these shoes got so popular but my God they are. I'm not complaining because they're not very expensive and it keeps me from having to buy $200 pairs of shoes for my kids just buy them a $30 pair of Crocs two to three times a year and they're happy.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'I am heartbroken.  The strap on my Crocs just broke and I am here to order another pair.  I should disclose that I bought this pair Sept. 26, 2018, and have worn them every. single. day. since then.  I slip into them first thing in the morning and comfortably go about my day after that.  I don\\'t have to think about them.  They protect my aging feet from alkaline soil, all sorts of prickly things in our high desert environment, rocks, and over-exuberant puppies. They are equally at home watering the garden, potting up plants, chasing chickens and grandchild, and puttering around in the kitchen.  They are an integral part of everyday life, but, really.....shouldn\\'t they last as long as I do?  I would have given them an eleven star rating, but this site must have foreseen my distress with the broken strap and I can only give them a 5.  My 3 year old grandchild calls them \"Nana\\'s shoes\" and has a pair just like them that she adores.  In fact, I took a good look at my Crocs to be absolutely sure I ordered the exact same ones and noticed that mine, like me I might add, were showing their age quite a bit.  There is little or no tread left on the sole.  I guess the many trips around our acreage, up and down the road, mile after mile, for over 2500 days will do that to a shoe.  The inner sole has been worn smooth as well.  And there is that broken strap... You know, it\\'s not even the actual strap... it\\'s the little button thing that attaches the strap to the shoe.  Well, in any event, it\\'s clearly time for a new pair.  May this pair be a part of many new adventures!',\n",

The downside is, well, they look like Crocs and for a guy. That may be. Tough to handle. To be honest. I don't wear them in front of my friends and even when I check my mail I take them off. And my mailbox is attached to my house right outside my front door. I just can't risk it. It was delivered in a box wrapped in a plastic bag. And even though it was box was wet, the bag was completely dry. New line this is my third pair so I will definitely buy more. As needed, I use them for recovery from plantar fasciitis.\",\n",
